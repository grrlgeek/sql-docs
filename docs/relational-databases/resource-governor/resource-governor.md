# Resource governor

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

You can use resource governor to manage [!INCLUDE[ssde-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] resource consumption and enforce policies for user workloads. Resource governor lets you reserve or limit the amount of CPU, memory, and physical I/O that user query workloads can use. You can also modify resource consumption behavior of each query, such as the degree of parallelism or the size of a memory grant.

For configuration and monitoring examples and to learn resource governor best practices, see [Tutorial: Resource governor configuration examples and best practices](resource-governor-walkthrough.md).

> [!NOTE]
> While [Azure SQL Database leverages resource governor](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/resource-governance-in-azure-sql-database/) (among other techniques) to manage resources, user configuration of resource pools and workload groups in Azure SQL Database isn't supported.
>
> Azure Synapse Analytics has a different implementation of a similar resource governance behavior via the [Workload classification feature](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-workload-classification).

## Benefits of resource governor

Resource governor enables you to manage [!INCLUDE[ssde-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] workloads and resources by specifying reservations and limits on resource consumption by requests. In the resource governor context, a workload is a set of queries (requests) that can, and should be, treated as a single entity. For example, all queries executed by a certain application might be considered a workload. While this isn't a requirement, the more uniform the resource usage pattern of a workload is, the more benefit you are likely to derive from resource governor.

If multiple distinct workloads are present on the same server, resource governor enables you to allocate resources differently to different workloads, based on the limits that you specify.

Some of the usage scenarios supported by resource governor are:

- Provide multitenancy and resource isolation on single instances of SQL Server that serve multiple client workloads. That is, you can divide the available resources on a server among the workloads and minimize the problems that can occur when workloads compete for resources.
- Provide predictable performance and support SLAs for workloads in a multi-workload and multi-user environment.
- Isolate and limit runaway queries, or limit I/O resources for I/O intensive operations that can saturate the I/O subsystem and negatively impact other workloads.
- Add fine-grained resource tracking for resource usage chargebacks and provide predictable billing to the consumers of server resources.

## Resource governor limitations

Resource governor has the following limitations:

- Resource management is limited to the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. Resource governor can't be used for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].
- Resource governor does not provide workload monitoring or workload management across multiple [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instances.
- Very short queries, such as queries in some OLTP workloads, might not use CPU long enough to apply CPU bandwidth controls. This might skew CPU usage statistics and limit the effectiveness of CPU resource governance.
- The ability to govern physical I/O applies only to user operations and not system tasks. System tasks perform transaction log, checkpoint, and lazy writer I/O. Resource governor governs user physical reads I/O but not write I/O performed by system tasks.
- You can't modify resource governance controls for the `internal` resource pool and workload group.

## Resource concepts

The following three concepts are fundamental to understanding and using resource governor:

- **Resource pool**. A resource pool represents a container for the physical resources of the server, such as CPU, memory, and I/O. Two built-in resource pools, `internal` and `default`, are always present. Resource governor also supports user-defined resource pools. Depending on configuration, resources in a resource pool can be shared with other pools or reserved. For more information, see [Resource governor resource pool](resource-governor-resource-pool.md).
- **Workload group**. A workload group represents a container for sessions that are classified in the same way. A workload group allows for aggregate monitoring of session and request resource consumption, and defines request policies. Each workload group is in a resource pool. Two built-in workload groups, `internal` and `default`, always exist and are mapped to the `internal` and `default` resource pools respectively. Resource governor also supports user-defined workload groups. For more information, see [Resource governor workload group](resource-governor-workload-group.md).
- **Classification**. The classification process assigns incoming sessions to a workload group based on the attributes of the session such as login name or program name, using your custom classification logic. Once a session is classified into a workload group, all requests executing on that session are subject to the workload group policies. You define the classification logic by writing a scalar user-defined function, called a classifier function. For more information, see [Resource governor classifier function](resource-governor-classifier-function.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Resource governor doesn't impose any controls on a [dedicated administrator connection (DAC)](../../database-engine/configure-windows/diagnostic-connection-for-database-administrators.md). DAC queries always run in the `internal` workload group and resource pool.

The following illustration shows resource governor components and their relationship with each other within the [!INCLUDE[ssde-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. From a processing perspective, the simplified flow is as follows:

- There is an incoming connection for a session (session 1 of `n`).
- The session is classified.
- Using the classification outcome, the session is assigned to a workload group, for example, `Group 4`.
- The workload group enforces its policies on all requests, and uses the resource pool it is associated with, for example, `Pool 2`.
- The resource pool provides and limits the resources required by the application, for example, `Application 3`.
